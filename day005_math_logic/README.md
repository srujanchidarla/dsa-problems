# Day 005: Mathematical Formulas & Logic ➗

## 🎯 Concept: Direct Formula Application and Basic Logic

Day 5 focuses on problems solved primarily through math concepts rather than complex data structure manipulation. Solutions should aim for $O(1)$ time complexity where possible (using formulas) or simple $O(N)$ iteration/recursion.
