# Day 015: Pure Recursion Fundamentals 🌲

## 🎯 Concept: Call Stack Management and Base Cases

Day 15 isolates the concept of recursion. The problems require solving a complex task by defining the solution in terms of smaller instances of itself. This is critical for understanding tree and graph traversal algorithms later.
