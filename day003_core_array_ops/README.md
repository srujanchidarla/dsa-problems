# Day 003: Core Array Operations 🔢

## 🎯 Concept: Linear Traversal and Basic Logic

Day 3 focuses on essential array traversal techniques, where solutions generally require a single pass ($O(N)$) to find statistics, sums, or missing elements. This builds directly on the $O(N)$ logic introduced on Day 1.
