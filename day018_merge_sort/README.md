# Day 018: Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer) 🔗

## 🎯 Concept: $O(N \log N)$ Time and Stable Sorting

Day 18 focuses on **Merge Sort**, a highly stable, comparison-based algorithm that guarantees $O(N \log N)$ performance by using extra $O(N)$ space during the merge step. The core lesson is the **Divide and Conquer** paradigm.
