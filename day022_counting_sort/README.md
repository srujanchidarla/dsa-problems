# Day 022: Counting Sort (Non-Comparison) 📊

## 🎯 Concept: $O(N + K)$ Linear Time Complexity

Day 22 introduces **Counting Sort**, which beats the comparison-based lower bound of $O(N \log N)$. It works by counting occurrences of each unique element, making it extremely fast when the range of input values ($K$) is not significantly larger than the number of elements ($N$).
