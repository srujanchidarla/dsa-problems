# Day 024: Kth Largest Element (Quickselect) 🎯

## 🎯 Concept: Selection Algorithm in $O(N)$ Average Time

Day 24 focuses on **Quickselect**, a variant of Quick Sort. Instead of sorting both halves of a partition, we only recurse into the half that contains our target $K$, achieving linear average time complexity.
