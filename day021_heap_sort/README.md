# Day 021: Heap Sort (Binary Heap) 🏗️

## 🎯 Concept: $O(N \log N)$ Selection via Priority Queue

Day 21 focuses on **Heap Sort**, which utilizes a Binary Heap data structure. It is an in-place algorithm that is particularly useful when you need to sort without the recursion overhead of Merge Sort or the worst-case risks of Quick Sort.
