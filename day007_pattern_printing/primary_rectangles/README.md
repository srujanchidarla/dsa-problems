# Filled and Hollow Rectangle Patterns

**Platform:** Custom | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Pattern:** Nested Loops

---

## Problem Description

The task is to print two fundamental patterns using nested loops, given dimensions $N$ (rows) and $M$ (columns):

1.  **Filled Rectangle:** Print a solid block of characters (e.g., `*`).
2.  **Hollow Rectangle:** Print a character only on the boundary (first/last row/column).

---

## Examples

### 1. Filled Rectangle (N=3, M=5)

### 2. Hollow Rectangle (N=4, M=5)

---

## Approaches

### 1. Filled Rectangle (Optimal) - $O(N \cdot M)$ ‚≠ê

**Idea:** The complexity is proportional to the area. Use one loop for rows ($i$) and one loop for columns ($j$).

### 2. Hollow Rectangle (Optimal) - $O(N \cdot M)$

**Idea:** Requires a conditional check inside the inner loop: print the character only if the current position is on the boundary.
The condition is: **`i == 0 || i == N-1 || j == 0 || j == M-1`**
