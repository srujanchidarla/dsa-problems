# Day 007: Pattern Printing

## 🎯 Concept: Nested Loop and Index Logic

Day 7 shifts focus to **Pattern Printing**, a foundational skill that tests proficiency with nested loops, conditional logic, and understanding the relationship between array indices (row `i`) and the output structure. All patterns are simulated by printing characters and spaces in $O(N^2)$ time.
